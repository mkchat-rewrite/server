# MK Chat
##### Formerly https://mkchat.net, https://mkchat.app
<br />

- MK Chat was created by [themkdev](https://github.com/themkdev) and later rewritten in entirety by me ([Distrust](https://github.com/0xDistrust)).
- This code is very buggy and there are multiple ways to overload/crash the server.
- This newly open-sourced version has been mildly improved to increase the security of sensitive variables (using env instead of a config file). This version is also licensed and versioned as "0.0.1". (This version has also not yet been tested because I cannot be bothered to clone the client to my pc).
- Support will not be provided.
- Feel free to rewrite this code, use pieces in your own project, or (allah willing) rehost the entire project. This includes all branches and their respective previous versions.
- The paired client can be found at https://github.com/mkchat-rewrite/client.
