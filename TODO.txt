done:
    websocket event/message handling with pub/sub and global braodcasting
    basic http routing (replaced with hono [https://honojs.dev/])

todo:
    account system with message & room ownership
    giphy integration
    mirror plugins (currently only discord is planned, however extensibility would be nice)
    store room messages so users can read previous messages

naming conventions or whatever:
 * use 'from' instead of 'to'; ex. formDataToObject -> objectFromFormData
 * use 'fetch' & 'generate' instead of 'get'; ex. getUsers -> fetchUsers, getRandomName -> generateRandomName
 * camel case - functions & variables
 * pascal case - Classes (ew) & types
 * capitalized snake case - constant variables; ex. env vars & api endpoints
